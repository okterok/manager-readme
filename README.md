# README for Maggie Gourlay
_A guide to me as a manager._

## What is this? 
Inspired by [this article](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe), this document is meant to give the reader a window into who I am as a manager of managers, now that I'm a Director of Engineering. With this, I hope to give insights around how I commit to helping my teams. This document will (and should) evolve and I welcome all feedback. There is a PDF version of this available upon request.

### A little bit about me
* 4 cats (Hyperion & Nyx & Casper & 宇宙人姫) ![cat](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7qbssgqiz1qmuulg.gif) ![cat](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7qbssgqiz1qmuulg.gif) ![cat](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7qbssgqiz1qmuulg.gif) ![cat](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7qbssgqiz1qmuulg.gif)
* 2 kids (boys, 14 & 16)
* Degree in Pure Mathematics, minor in CS
* 16+ years in software, doing QA and managing engineering teams
* Live in Boulder, CO

In my spare time I enjoy:
* Playing video games (usually MMOs and strategy games) and board games
* Being outside or traveling (when there's not a pandemic :/ )
* Having adventures with my kids
* Music (honestly most kinds I like, but I recently have largely been listening to metal)

And finally...
* I like documentation but also like to evolve process over time
* I am strongly in favor of not asking someone else to do something I wouldn’t take on myself. 
* I'm not a morning person so please forgive occasional grogginess

### A little bit about my background
I began my career testing video games for EA Sports. I was then an individual contributor as a quality assurance engineer and an SDET. I've lead and managed teams much of my career, but I'm happiest helping teams of engineers achieve their goals and through their struggles. I have worked with C++, java, javascript, python, ruby and scala in some form thoughout my career. Although I enjoy writing code, I've not done it exclusively in a few years but I enjoy being a sounding board for questions and looking at pull requests (though not as the sole reviewer). Please feel free to include me, if that's something you'd like! 

### My job
My title is now Senior Engineering Manager, as of November 2020 at FireHydrant. I love my job because I get to help smart people work together on a cool software projects. I just started at FireHydrant, so please be patient as I learn the ropes. 

To help shape how I perform my duties, I have set some goals which will give context to how or why I make the choices I do. I am not perfect, so if there’s an area for me to improve, please speak up :).

### My goals
My main goals:
* Help you achieve your goals, both personal and professional
* Support your efforts however I can
* Provide context for what you’re working on
* Provide and act upon constructive feedback with you
* Advocate for you and your team with the rest of FireHydrant

### My team
[TBD]

### Collaboration
I highly value collaboration. Collectively, we can unlock special super powers.
When you were hired, it was in part because of your experience and skills. I respect your knowledge in these areas and ask you respect those of your colleagues in engineering.

If you feel your efforts to collaborate have been hindered, please speak with me so I can help smooth out the path.

### Average work day for me
* I will typically come online between 6:30am - 7:00am my time.
* I have 1-1s once a week with my reports, though this varies based on need
* I tend to leave around 3:30pm - 4:40pm my time

Please let me know if you'd like to meet outside of these hours and I can likely accomodate that!

### Nights and weekends
Nights & weekends are your own.  On occasion, I will end up catching up on a few things after hours or on weekends. _This is something I have chosen and is not something you should feel obligated to emulate._ 

### Scheduling
My calendar is currently fairly empty but historically, it tends to fill up. Even it it appears very full; don’t let this scare you! Please still reach out if you'd like to talk; I will make time to speak with you.  If I cannot move a prior engagement, I will find the next available time for both of us.

I am here for you, and as such strive to make time to help so please ask!

### Communication, in general
I appreciate open and honest communication, even if it's hard to hear or give. I recognize it might not be easy to give or receive candid feedback, so if you are most comfortable with a given mechanism (Slack, email, Zoom, etc) please let me know.  

### Slack
I will keep my Slack on while I'm working. Please feel free to send me a message whenever something comes up and know I'll respond when I next can. If your dot is green, I might send you a message. Most of the time, this should not be considered urgent to respond to - just when you get a moment, I ask for you to have a look. 

### 1-1s
I’ll be meeting with you on a regular cadence to discuss pretty much whatever you’d like. Some ideas of things we could talk about include:
* Struggles / fun things which have happened over the week at work
* Where you'd like to grow your career, knowledge base, skillset
* How you're doing in your current work
* Things you're looking forward to / dreading
* Personal goals (such as riding your bike more, remembering to take breaks, learning to knit, etc)

If you feel stuck on what to talk about, let me know and I can bring some topics (I have a deck of potential questions).

You and I can also have a private a Google doc or Slack channel, where you can drop in things you'd like to talk about as they come up. Please ping me in Slack for more urgent matters, but for longer-term things, this can help us keep track of goals, ideas, woes and triumphs. 

### Feedback (for me)
I appreciate any and all feedback. The only way I can improve is understanding your preferences and concerns along with my own shortcomings. Please let me know how I can improve! I like learning and growing which is only possible when I know about problems.

If you do not feel comfortable sharing this feedback directly with me, I welcome you to share it with Dan.

### Feedback (for you)
When wins occur, I like to call them out as they happen, usually in Slack or, for bigger wins, even an email. If this isn’t something you like, please let me know and I’ll let you know however you'd prefer. 

On an as-needed basis, I will take you aside privately (either in a 1-1 or if possible sooner) to let you know any misses you’ve had. I will also work with you to find solutions.

### Feedback (for others) 
In the event you encounter conflict with others (on your team, in engineering, in other parts of the company), I encourage you to do whatever you’re most comfortable with:
* Speak with the person (if you feel comfortable doing so)
* Speak with me

We are all in this together but sometimes opinions or personalities clash. Remember, I’ve got your back in these situations and so do Dan, Bobby and Dylan. 

I encourage you to keep documentation around conversations or interactions you've found uncomfortable. It will help me to better understand the context. I've found the 1-1 doc to be a good place for this as it is confidential.

### Conclusion / Next steps
I hope this helps to get to know me a little better. I am looking forward working with you and getting to know you better and learning from you. If making a Readme for yourself sounds like something you’d like to do, I’d love to see one. If not, we can spend time or our 1-1s :)
