# README for Margaret L Gourlay
_A guide to me as a manager_

## What is this? 
Inspired by [this article](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe), this document is meant to give the reader a window into who I am as a manager and how I commit to helping my team(s). This document will (and should) evolve and I welcome all feedback. There is a PDF version of this available upon request.

### A little bit about me
* 2 kids (boys, 12 & 13)
* 2 cats (Hyperion & Nyx) ![cats](http://orig02.deviantart.net/2a12/f/2013/280/8/c/jiji_pixel_art_by_sniffle27-d6pnstz.png)
* Degree in Pure Mathematics, minor in CS
* 16+ years in software, largely QA teams

In my spare time I enjoy:
* Playing video games (usually MMOs)
* Being outside or traveling
* Having adventures with my kids

And finally...
* I have strong opinions, loosely held (so please change them!)
* I am strongly in favor of not asking someone else to do something I wouldnâ€™t take on myself.
