# README for Margaret L Gourlay
_A guide to me as a manager_

## What is this? 
Inspired by [this article](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe), this document is meant to give the reader a window into who I am as a manager and how I commit to helping my team(s). This document will (and should) evolve and I welcome all feedback. There is a PDF version of this available upon request.

### A little bit about me
* 2 cats (Hyperion & Nyx) ![cat](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7qbssgqiz1qmuulg.gif) ![cat](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7qbssgqiz1qmuulg.gif)
* 2 kids (boys, 12 & 13)
* Degree in Pure Mathematics, minor in CS
* 16+ years in software, largely QA teams

In my spare time I enjoy:
* Playing video games (usually MMOs)
* Being outside or traveling
* Having adventures with my kids

And finally...
* I have strong opinions, loosely held (so please change them!)
* I am strongly in favor of not asking someone else to do something I wouldn’t take on myself. 

### My job
My title is Engineering Manager (and it makes me very happy to say that). I love my job because I get to help smart people work together on a pretty cool piece of software for a company who values both the product and the people who make it. To help shape how I perform my duties, I have set some goals which will give context to how or why I make the choices I do. I am not perfect, so if there’s an area for me to improve, please speak up :).

### My goals
I have 5 main goals:
* Help you achieve your goals
* Support your efforts however I can
* Provide context for what you’re working on
* Advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company
* Ensure a high standard of quality is met in our work

### My teams
I have the great honor to manage three teams:
* Mobile: iOS and Android engineers who write the coolest mobile app for being on-call ever
* SDET (aka Conundrum Peak): Software Development Engineers in Test who help write automation for our delivery teams
* Manual QA (aka Quandary Peak): QA Analysts who ferret out the strangest bugs our engineers have missed and who help with day-to-day QA work for delivery teams

### Collaboration
I highly value collaboration. Collectively, we can unlock special super powers.
When you were hired, it was in part because of your experience and skills. I respect your knowledge in these areas and ask you respect those of your colleagues in engineering.

If you feel your efforts to collaborate have been hindered, please speak with me so I can help smooth out the path.

### Average work day (for you)
* Arrive before stand up (varies by team)
* Expect Agile ceremonies roughly once or twice per week
* There are deploys typically Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday depending on team; it’s encouraged to attend and help!
* You might be asked to attend our meetings with Support
* If you are on call for something, you might get paged
* Remember to take a moment to bring a coworker to get some coffee or tea

### Average work day (for me)
* I attend stand ups and Agile ceremonies on request (so let me know)
* I have 1-1s as often as people would like them 
* I meet with the Tech Team Leads once a week, every Tuesday morning
* I meet with the Engineering management team once a week, every Thursday morning
* I meet to tackle higher level topics for my teams such as:
** Quality concerns
** Feature designs
** Staff augmentation

### Nights and weekends
Nights & weekends are your own.  On occasion, I will end up catching up on a few things after hours or on weekends. _This is something I have chosen and is not something you should feel obligated to emulate._ As a rule, people at VictorOps do not work nights or weekends.

Caveat: Most people at VictorOps _are_ on call at some point. This will occastionally mean you will be paged on a night or weekend. Being on call gives us empathy for our users as well as helping us own quality on production. 

### Scheduling
My calendar often appears very full. Don’t let this scare you! Often my meetings are movable. Please go ahead and invite me to meetings with you, even if there appears to be a conflict.  If I cannot move my prior engagement, I will find the next available time for both of us.

I am here for you, and as such strive to make time to help so please ask!

### More about meetings
If you prefer to bring your laptop to meetings, please feel free to do so. I do not bring my laptop to meetings unless it is vital to the meeting. This is because I know I will not be able to give the people the attention and respect you deserve if I am also on my computer. I recognize others find laptops necessary at meetings and respect this however I ask that you remain focused and attentive to the purpose of the meeting. If an emergency arises (such as being paged for an incident) you're free to triage it but I ask that you politely excuse yourself from the meeting first.

### Communication
I prefer in-person communication when that’s possible. If this is not possible, I encourage you to try Slack first. Note that if I am in a meeting, I might not respond right away so a good fall-back for emergencies is phone call or SMS. 
For matters which require more than the two of us, or which are more involved, I encourage emails. I also will send emails on a somewhat frequent basis to help asynchronously have conversations or solidify meeting agendas. 

### 1-1s
I’ll be meeting with you on a regular cadence to discuss pretty much whatever you’d like. To help me schedule these please let me know if you’d prefer:
* Location (for example: in office, at a coffee shop, getting gelato, on a walk)
* Frequency (for example: once per week, twice per month, once per month month)
* Time of Day such as morning or afternoon
* Which day of the week

### Feedback (for me)
I appreciate any and all feedback. The only way I can improve being your manager is understanding your preferences and concerns. Please let me know how I can improve! I like learning and growing which is only possible when I know about problems.

### Feedback (for you)
When wins occur, I like to call them out as they happen in a positive way. If this isn’t something you like, please let me know and I’ll let you know more privately. 

On an as-needed basis, I will take you aside privately (either in a 1-1 or if possible sooner) to let you know any misses you’ve had. I will also work with you to find solutions.

### Feedback (for others) 
In the event you encounter conflict with others (on your team, in engineering, in other parts of the company), I encourage you to do whatever you’re most comfortable with:
* Speak with the person (if you feel comfortable doing so)
* Speak with your lead
* Speak with me
We are all in this together but sometimes opinions or personalities clash. Remember, I’ve got your back in these situations and so does your lead. 

### Conclusion / Next steps
I hope this helps to get to know me a little better. I am looking forward working with you and getting to know you better and learning from you. If making a Readme for yourself sounds like something you’d like to do, I’d love to see one. If not, we can spend time at lunch or our 1-1s :)
